# ASQ - Answer Student Questions

We are building a system which collects audio/video recordings from teachers and let students look up with keywords based on the actual verbal content. ASQ will also match each audio/video file with the syllabus or text book of this course to estimate the possible inputs that students would enter in order to increase the accuracy of voice recognition.
